# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Weather App

Description: The Weather App is a modern and interactive web application built with ReactJS that provides real-time weather updates for any location around the globe. This project demonstrates my proficiency in ReactJS and my ability to integrate and consume external APIs effectively.

Key Features:

    Real-Time Weather Data: Fetches current weather information, including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions, using the OpenWeatherMap API.
    Search Functionality: Allows users to search for weather data by city name or geographical coordinates.
    Responsive Design: Designed to be fully responsive and user-friendly across various devices and screen sizes.
    Dynamic Updates: Automatically updates weather information based on user input or location changes.
    Error Handling: Includes error handling for invalid searches and API connectivity issues.

Technologies Used:

    ReactJS: Utilized for building the user interface and managing application state.
    Axios: Used for making API requests and handling responses.
    CSS3/SCSS: Applied for styling the application and ensuring a polished, professional look.
    OpenWeatherMap API: Provides weather data for the application, allowing real-time and accurate weather information.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
